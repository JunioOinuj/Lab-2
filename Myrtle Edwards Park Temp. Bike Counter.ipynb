Then I delete the first row, that contains my headers for each column in my dataset, in my myrtle_data, which is labelled row 0. Next, I make 2 empty lists for my 2 columns of data, one containing the data for bikes heading NW and the other for bikes heading SE. After that, I use the Split function to help split the row into four different Lists, each one representing a column of data. Finally, because there is some data missing from my dataset, I try the code given to me by Rihan and Ms. Sconyers and append it, therefore adding to it from another List, so I can work around the missing data. I enter in the number of the column that holds the data for the bikes heading NW and the ones heading SE. If that code doesn't work, then the except: pass code will tell the whole code not to run the codes with append in it."

    "### In conclusion, there were more bikes heading NW on Myrtle Edwards than bikes heading SE. Although both directions had a minimum of 0 bikes headed their way, bikes headed NE had a maximum of 115 more bikes more than bikes headed towards SE. Furthermore, although both lists had the same number of items in their list, NE_bikes had higher values than the ones in SE_bikes, resulting in not only a higher sum of values of all the items in the individual lists, but also a higher average. Due to these numbers, one can only wonder about and question the chosen dataset. For example, are there more people living in the direction of NE? Are the bikers headed towards NE ones who routinely bike or was there a biking event on a certain day? Do less people live in the SE? Does the weather influence how many bikers bike in either directions? Do more climate change aware people live in the NE? Why is there data missing? Would the missing data affect the minimums, maximums and averages of both lists? There are a million other questions that can be asked about this dataset and these are only the beginning."
